## 🧩 The Problem We Solve

Most sports apps:

- Focus on a single league, country, or broadcaster
- Make users juggle multiple sources just to track schedules
- Are cluttered or biased toward certain teams or networks

**Scoretab** solves these issues by:

- Aggregating schedules from over 50 sports and global competitions
- Providing real-time match updates, TV listings, and reminders
- Staying neutral—fan-first, not league-first

With Scoretab, following multiple teams across time zones is easy and stress-free.
